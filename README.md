# CROZONO - Community edition

CROZONO is a modular framework designed to automate the penetration testing of wireless networks from drones and such unconventional devices.

The core automates the execution of attacks and scripts which are to be placed in the `src/attacks` folder

## Requirements
Python requirements are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. As always, the use of `virtualenv` is recommended.

Non-python requirements are: The `aircrack-ng` suite, `wash`, `reaver`, `macchanger`, and any eventual binaries that the attacks may implement.

It is highly recommended to run CROZONO using the Kali Linux distribution as it will already contain most (if not all) required dependencies.

### TODO
- Example parameters
- Video demo
- Thorough install instructions
